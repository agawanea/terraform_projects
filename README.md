# Serverless cross account ALB->PrivateAPI use-case using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Application Load Balancer, VPC Endpoint

This serverless pattern allows users from one account to access their Private REST APIs present in another account over the internet. This facilitates abstraction of network resources (like load balancers, virtual private clouds, endpoints) & application resources (like lambda, api gateway) into separate  individual management accounts.

## Requirements

* [Create two AWS accounts](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have, create them and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli?in=terraform/aws-get-started) installed

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-pattern
    ```
1. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd public-alb-private-api-terraform
    ```
1. From the command line, initialize terraform to  to downloads and installs the providers defined in the configuration:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```
1. From the command line, apply the configuration in the main.tf file:
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```
1. During the prompts:

   var.custom_domain_name_prefix
    - Enter a value: *{enter only your domain name prefix}*

   var.domain_name
    -  Enter a value: *{enter your domain name}*

   var.region
    - Enter a value: *{enter the region for deployment}*


1. Note the outputs from the deployment process. It contain the full url link which can be used for testing.

## Testing

1. Run the following curl command to invoke the cross account Private Rest API:
```
curl https://<custom_domain>/<stage-name> -H 'Host:<execute-api-invoke-url>'
```

2. Observe the output of the Private API response from the integrated backend Lambda function:
```
Run the below command 
```

## Cleanup
 
1. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd serverless-patterns/public-alb-private-api-terraform
    ```
1. Delete all created resources
    ```bash
    terraform destroy
    ```
1. During the prompts:
    * Enter all details same as entered during creation.

1. Confirm all created resources has been deleted
    ```bash
